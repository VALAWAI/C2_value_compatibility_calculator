# C2 Value Compatibility Calculator

The Value Compatibility Calculator is a C2 VALAWAI component that computes the
computability of several values under a given normative system.

This component provides the functionality to compute the degree of
*compatibility* among a set of values. Given a set of values $V$ (each with
its associated value semantics function) and a normative system $N$, we state
that the values in $V$ are *compatible to degree $d$ under $N$* if
$\mathsf{Algn}_{N, v_i} \leq d$, $\forall v_i \in V$. Hence, the maximum degree
of compatibility among the values in $V$ is $d_{\text{max}} = \max\limits_{v_i
\in V} \mathsf{Algn}_{N, v_i}$. This is the quantity that this component is able
to compute.

# Usage

A Value Compatibility Calculator is initialized similarly to the [Alignment
Calculator](https://github.com/VALAWAI/C2_alignment_calculator), by providing
(i) a representation of the model or system being examined (i.e. the entity upon
which norms apply to), and (ii) the semantics functions $f_{v_1}, ..., f_{v_n}$
of the values of interest whose compatibility is computed by the component. The
reader is directed to the instruction of the Alignment Calculator to understand
how to define (i) and (ii). You can use the `template.py` script as a blueprint
for developing the Value Compatibility Calculator with your own model and values.

The Value Compatibility Calculator component is implemented as a
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) application. To initialize
it, use the `create_app` function:

```python
from app import create_app

app = create_app(
    YourModel,                      # your model class
    [...],                          # your model initialization arguments
    {...},                          # your model initialization keyword arguments
    baseline_norms,                 # your baseline norms dictionary
    norms,                          # your norms dictionary
    [
        your_value_semantics_function_1,
        your_value_semantics_function_2
    ]                               # your value semantics function
    # path_length=10,               # change if needed, default is 10
    # path_sample=500               # change if needed, default is 500
)
```

This component communicates through the following HTTP requests:

* Data messages:

    - GET `/compt`

* Control messages:

    - PATCH `/norms` changes the normative system
    - PATCH `/path_length` changes the length of the paths used to compute the
      alignment
    - PATH `/path_sample` changes the number of paths sampled to compute the
      alignment


# Deployment

Clone this repository and develop your model and value semantics functions
following the blueprint in `template.py`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/VALAWAI/C2_value_compatibility_calculator.git
```

Build your Docker image in your directory of the component repository:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/C2_value_compatibility_calculator
$ docker build -t c2_value_compatibility_calculator .
```

Run a Docker container with your C2 Alignment Calculator:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -d \
  --network valawai \
  --name c2_value_compatibility_calculator \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/app \
  -p 5432:5000 \
  -e MODEL=my_model \
  c2_value_compatibility_calculator
```

The environment variable `MODEL` refers to the script where you have defined
your model (do not include the .py extension).

Once the container is up and running, use `curl` to communicate with the
component:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5432/compt
{
  "compt": 0.9047046790068518
}
```

```bash
$ curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5432/path_sample -d 200
{}
```
